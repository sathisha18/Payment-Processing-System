# Payment-Processing-Service
This project involves developing a core payment system for an e-commerce client using Stripe and Razorpay payment gateway integration.
The project is built using Java and Spring Boot, utilizing microservices architecture. It focuses on providing a reliable, scalable, and secure payment processing system.
Developed a robust payment processing system using Spring Boot for backend development.  
Integrated third-party payment APIs (such as Stripe, Razorpay.) for processing transactions. 
Built RESTful APIs for efficient handling of payment requests and responses.

## Key Features

<!-- 
    List and briefly describe the main features of the project.
    Mention the technologies and methods used to implement these features.
-->
- **Stripe API Integration**: Seamlessly integrated Stripe for handling payments, including processing notifications and managing payment statuses.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Utilized a modular approach to develop independent services such as payment processing and Stripe provider services.
- **High Performance**: Implemented thread pools and optimized error handling mechanisms to ensure high performance and reliability.
- **Security**: Integrated security layers and used Stripe-provided authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive payment data.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leveraged ActiveMQ for asynchronous communication within the e-commerce system.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Developed an error handling system with custom error codes and utilized Spring exception handling for effective error management.
